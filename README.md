RIT's Most Interesting Features
================

RIT is a massive campus. There are few things that stand out on this campus such as the Tiger Statue, the Sundial, the fountain that is always soaped, and that funky statue in the middle of the infinity quad. But... did you know RIT has an observatory just off campus? How about the time capsule that's buried just outside the ramp to Monroe Hall? Do you know what that statue between Building 9 and Institute Hall represents? Or did you know that RIT has a fitness lab that does exercise program creation and fitness evaluation? The fact is there are several really cool hidden landmarks, features, and services here at RIT that people might be missing out on.

This github.io page is a webpage that will display each of these locations on an interactive map. Clicking on a location will pop up information regarding it, a description of what it represents, a link to more information, and/or a picture.

With all of these features mapped, it can give students more insight as to what they are walking past every day. They might even discover services they had no idea RIT had to offer!
